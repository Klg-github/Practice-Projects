12/28/24 CSV Price Graph: Graphs price data from a csv file, colors segments where price increases as green and segments where price decreases as red. Can graph open, close, high, and low prices and choose the title. The CSV file must be formatted to have the Date, Open, Close, ect as the titles of the columns. I haven't added too many features such as being able to compare different sets of data such as the open and close times for the dates or the close prices for two different stocks. I also haven't made it the most user friendly so if an error is made while using the program, it will probably return a generic error.
